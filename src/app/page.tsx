          Visas are annoying right??? atleast this is the case for
          people that have shitty passports (I'm in this boat ðŸ˜­)

          This site is intended to help people not overstay their visas
          and hopefully prevent their asses from getting deported.
        </span>
        <span>
          Just enter your past departure dates and the country you found yourself in.
          With a little quick maths, I'll break down your tenure and determine whether
          you are at risk of breaching the terms of your visa. ðŸ«¨

          PS: Dont take my advice as gospel - im just some random dude on the internet
          and do NOT specialise in immigration law. <br/>
          PSS: Im taking my own advice so if its any consolation.
