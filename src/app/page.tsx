        Visas are annoying right? atleast this is the case for
        people that have shitty passports (I'm in this boat ðŸ˜­)
        This site is intended to help people not overstay their visas
        and hopefully prevent their asses from getting deported.
        I will continue to work on this over time and will be adding features when I can.
        PR's are welcome
